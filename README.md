> tanga=tang server on android; use android to unlock a LUKS encrypted disk of a linux machine

Guide to show the steps required to use NBDE (network bound disk encryption) to **automatically unlock** a **LUKS** encrypted partition, for example when an android device is on the same (WIFI) network as a linux machine.

# tribute
to the main inventors/maintainers of most of the awesomeness that we make use of here:
- Nathaniel McCallum https://github.com/npmccallum for the NBDE part.
- Clemens Fruhwirth https://clemens.endorphin.org/p/about-me.html for the LUKS part.

Open source is a big community, for sure I forgot many other important people, just raise an issue!
